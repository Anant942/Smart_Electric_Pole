# Smart_Electric_Pole
Successfully completed an IOT project on saving people's life from unwanted deaths due to electric shock from electric poles.
This mini device is linked with live server from where data of live reading of power on pole can be fetched by electric department.

Whenever shock is detected on body of the pole the circuit would breakdown and a notification will be send to electrical department , the pole could be located via gps.
There are cases where electric wires get breakdown due to storm and may fall on wet roads which spreads current over that area....But this device would eventually break the circuit.
It had an alarming system to ensure that people don't come in contact with the pole.
This will surely prevent unwanted deaths.
Also smart automation of Street lights could be done using this chargeable device.
